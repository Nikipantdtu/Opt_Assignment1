- `Task_1c.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 1c
- `Task_2b.ipynb`: Notebook for Task 2b
- `data/`: Folder with data for different tasks
- `utils/`: Folder with scripts for classes, data, helper and plot functions
- Licensing information
- Dependency files (`requirements.txt`)
- A `.gitignore` file
- This `README.md` with setup and usage instructions

## Notebook Overview

The repository includes four Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate and visualize the optimization tasks interactively.  
These notebooks provide a step-by-step exploration of model formulations, results, and sensitivity analyses.

| Notebook | Description | Key Focus |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **`Task_1a.ipynb`** | Introduces the **consumer-level flexibility model** for a single flexible load with rooftop PV generation. The model optimizes hourly load scheduling to minimize daily electricity cost under full flexibility. | Baseline optimization, PV self-consumption, cost minimization |
| **`Task_1b.ipynb`** | Extends Task 1a by including **discomfort minimization** from deviating from a preferred load profile. The consumer balances energy cost savings and comfort penalties. | Load shifting, discomfort cost, flexibilityâ€“comfort trade-off |
| **`Task_1c.ipynb`** | Adds a **battery energy storage system (BESS)** to the consumer model, combining load shifting, PV self-consumption, and storage dispatch to maximize flexibility benefits. | Battery integration, energy arbitrage, combined flexibility modeling |
| **`Task_2b.ipynb`** | Expands from operational optimization to **battery investment analysis**. Evaluates optimal battery sizing, profitability, and payback under different market scenarios. | Investment optimization, NPV analysis, sensitivity to price scenarios |
